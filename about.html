        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Annyeong! I'm from the mid 90s. I joined the net in the early 2000s through dialup, and I've sank more time
            into surfing than I ever will into any other activity, gaming excluded. Here is my attempt to bring back the
            magic of personal websites before social media really took off and ruined everything.</p>
